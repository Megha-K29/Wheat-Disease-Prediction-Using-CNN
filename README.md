# Wheat-Disease-Prediction-Using-CNN

Developed a robust CNN model to classify and predict different diseases in wheat using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy levels on validation datasets. The model was trained using image data augmented with various techniques to enhance its ability to generalize from the training dataset to unseen data.
Implemented and managed the full machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and model building to training, validation, and deployment. Utilized Google Colab for efficient resource management and TensorFlow for constructing and training the neural network.
